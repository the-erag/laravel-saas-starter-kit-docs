# Laravel Email Verification: Signed Links, Fortify and the verified Middleware

<BlogPostMeta />

Anyone can type any address into a sign-up form. Laravel email verification checks that the person behind an account can actually read that inbox before they get to the parts of your app that matter. We'll go through how the built-in flow works, how to turn it on with Laravel Fortify and how to build the "check your inbox" page in Inertia. Then the edge cases: changed emails, expired links and users who open the link on a different device.

## How Laravel email verification works

Laravel ships every piece of the flow. Fortify just adds the routes and controllers on top.

```text
POST /register
  → Registered event
  → SendEmailVerificationNotification listener
  → VerifyEmail notification with a temporary signed URL
User clicks the link
  → GET /email/verify/{id}/{hash}   (auth, signed, throttle)
  → email_verified_at = now(), Verified event
  → redirect to your app with ?verified=1
```

What makes the link safe is how it's built. It's signed, so the `signed` middleware rejects any URL whose query string was changed. It expires after `auth.verification.expire` minutes, 60 by default. And it's tied to the address: the `hash` segment is a SHA-1 of the user's current email, so once the email changes, old links stop working.

The framework registers the listener for you. It only sends the email when the user model implements `MustVerifyEmail` and the user isn't verified yet.

## Step 1: Implement MustVerifyEmail

Laravel's base `User` class already uses the `MustVerifyEmail` trait. That trait gives you `hasVerifiedEmail()`, `markEmailAsVerified()` and `sendEmailVerificationNotification()`. It isn't what switches verification on, though. The **interface** is:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\MustVerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements MustVerifyEmail
{
    // ...
}
```

Without the interface, the listener sends nothing and the `verified` middleware lets everyone through. It's the most common reason verification emails never arrive, so it's the first thing we'd check. The `users` table also needs a nullable `email_verified_at` timestamp, which the default migration already has.

## Step 2: Enable the Fortify routes

If you use [Laravel Fortify](/blog/laravel-fortify-tutorial.html), add the feature in `config/fortify.php`:

```php
'features' => [
    Features::registration(),
    Features::emailVerification(),
    // ...
],
```

Fortify then registers three routes, all for signed-in users:

| Method | URI | Route name | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/email/verify` | `verification.notice` | The "check your inbox" page |
| GET | `/email/verify/{id}/{hash}` | `verification.verify` | The link in the email |
| POST | `/email/verification-notification` | `verification.send` | Resend the email |

The link and resend routes are throttled by the limiter in `fortify.limiters.verification`, which allows six requests per minute by default. On top of that, the link route checks that the `id` belongs to the signed-in user and that the `hash` matches their current email.

Next, tell Fortify which page to render for the notice:

```php
Fortify::verifyEmailView(fn (Request $request) => Inertia::render('auth/VerifyEmail', [
    'status' => $request->session()->get('status'),
]));
```

Users who are already verified never see that page. The notice route redirects them straight into the app.

## Step 3: Protect routes with the verified middleware

Verification is pointless unless something depends on it. Put `verified` next to `auth` on every route that should need a confirmed address:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/dashboard', DashboardController::class)->name('dashboard');
    // billing, team settings, anything that sends email to others
});
```

An unverified user who hits one of these routes gets redirected to `verification.notice`. JSON requests get a 403 with "Your email address is not verified." instead. If you want users sent somewhere else, pass a route name: `verified:onboarding.verify`.

Keep the profile and logout routes outside `verified`. Someone who typed the wrong address needs a way to fix it.

## The "check your inbox" page in Inertia

This page needs two actions: resend the email, and log out. After a resend, Fortify flashes `status` as `verification-link-sent`, so show a confirmation when you get that value:

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { Form } from '@inertiajs/vue3';
import { send } from '@/routes/verification';

defineProps<{ status?: string }>();
</script>

<template>
    <p v-if="status === 'verification-link-sent'">A new link is on its way.</p>

    <Form v-bind="send.form()" v-slot="{ processing }">
        <button type="submit" :disabled="processing">Resend verification email</button>
    </Form>
</template>
```

We'd also show which address the link went to, with a way to change it. Most "I never got the email" tickets are typos.

## Customising the verification email

You can change both the message and the URL from a service provider's `boot()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Auth\Notifications\VerifyEmail;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\MailMessage;

VerifyEmail::toMailUsing(function (object $notifiable, string $url) {
    return (new MailMessage)
        ->subject('Confirm your email for '.config('app.name'))
        ->line('Click the button below to finish setting up your account.')
        ->action('Confirm email', $url);
});
```

`VerifyEmail::createUrlUsing()` replaces the link itself, which is handy when a separate frontend handles the click. To change how long links last, add a `verification.expire` value (in minutes) to `config/auth.php`.

By default the notification goes out synchronously, so a slow mail server makes registration slow. We'd queue it. Create a notification that extends `VerifyEmail`, implements `ShouldQueue` and uses the `Queueable` trait, then override `sendEmailVerificationNotification()` on your user model so it sends that class instead. Don't forget to run a queue worker.

## When a user changes their email

A verified account that switches to a new address is unverified again. Handle that where the profile gets updated, and put it in a service rather than the controller:

```php
$user->fill($data);

if ($user->isDirty('email')) {
    $user->email_verified_at = null;
}

$user->save();

if ($user->wasChanged('email') && $user instanceof MustVerifyEmail) {
    $user->sendEmailVerificationNotification();
}
```

Since the link hash is built from the current email, any link sent to the old address is now useless.

## Edge cases to plan for

| Situation | What happens | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User opens the link on another device | The route requires login, so they are sent to the login page first | After login they are redirected back to the link and verified |
| Link has expired | The `signed` middleware returns a 403 | Make the resend button easy to find |
| Link clicked twice | Already verified; the user is simply redirected | Nothing |
| User was invited by an admin | They proved ownership by opening the invite link | Set `email_verified_at` when they accept, see [user invitations with signed URLs](/blog/laravel-user-invitations-signed-urls.html) |
| Accounts created by seeders | No email is sent | Set `email_verified_at` in the seeder |

In local development, set `MAIL_MAILER=log` and copy the link out of `storage/logs/laravel.log`.

## Frequently asked questions

### Why is Laravel not sending the verification email?

Usually the user model doesn't implement `MustVerifyEmail`, so the listener skips it. After that, check your mail settings. If you queued the notification, make sure a queue worker is running.

### How long is a Laravel email verification link valid?

Sixty minutes by default. You can change it with `verification.expire` in `config/auth.php`. Once it has expired, the user requests a new link from the notice page.

### Can users log in before verifying their email?

Yes. Verification doesn't block login. It blocks the routes you protect with the `verified` middleware, and that's exactly what lets unverified users reach the resend page.

### Should I block login until the email is verified?

We wouldn't. Letting users in and gating the important routes gives them a clear next step. If signup abuse is the worry, combine verification with [rate limiting on login](/blog/laravel-login-rate-limiting.html) and a rate limit on your registration route.

## Email verification in SaaS Laravel

In the SaaS Laravel kits, most of this is already in place. They enable `Features::emailVerification()` and include a Verify Email page in Vue, React and Svelte with resend and logout buttons. The app's module routes use `['auth', 'verified']`. One catch: `App\Models\User` ships **without** `MustVerifyEmail` (the import is commented out), so verification isn't enforced until you add the interface. The profile settings page resets `email_verified_at` when the email changes and offers a resend link. Seeded users, and invited users who accept, are marked as verified, and each tenant domain can turn verification off. The details are in [email verification in the authentication docs](/docs/core/authentication.html#email-verification).
