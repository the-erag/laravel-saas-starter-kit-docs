# Laravel Inertia Translations: Sharing Lang Files with Vue, React and Svelte

<BlogPostMeta />

Laravel Inertia translations run into one awkward problem straight away. Your strings live in PHP files under `lang/`, but your interface is rendered by JavaScript components. Laravel's `__()` helper works perfectly in controllers, mail and validation, and it does nothing at all for a Vue, React or Svelte page.

I'll go through the usual ways to bridge that gap, show how the `erag/laravel-lang-sync-inertia` package handles it, and then cover the details that come up once an app is genuinely multilingual: per-user language, validation messages, file organisation, plurals and payload size.

## The problem: two worlds, one set of strings

In a Blade app, every string is translated on the server. With Inertia, Laravel still handles routing, validation and data, but the markup is built in the browser from page props. So where should translation happen?

You could translate everything on the server and pass finished strings as props. That's fine for a handful of strings, but it clutters every controller fast. You could keep a separate set of frontend translation files, but then you're maintaining two sets of files that slowly drift apart. Or you send the translation files themselves to the frontend and translate there.

Most Inertia apps land on that last option, and I think it's the right call: **one source of truth in `lang/`**, shared with the frontend.

## Ways to share Laravel translations with Inertia

| Approach | How it works | Trade-offs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Shared Inertia prop | Middleware loads PHP lang files and shares them as a prop | Simple, always in sync; the strings travel with the page response |
| JSON generated at build time | A command converts `lang/*.php` to JSON the frontend can read | Fast lookups; you must regenerate after every change |
| Generic i18n library | A frontend i18n library loads its own message files | Powerful formatting; a second format and a second set of conventions to learn |

None of these is wrong. The part that matters is keeping PHP as the source of truth, so a validation message and a button label can never disagree.

## How erag/laravel-lang-sync-inertia works

The package combines the first two approaches. There's a Composer package for Laravel and a small npm package, `@erag/lang-sync-inertia`, for the frontend.

### Option A: load files per page with `syncLangFiles()`

Call the global `syncLangFiles()` helper in a controller before rendering. It loads one or more groups for the current locale and shares them under the `lang` prop:

```php
public function index(): Response
{
    syncLangFiles(['auth', 'modules.tenant']);

    return Inertia::render('tenants/Index');
}
```

Dot notation reads nested files, so `modules.tenant` loads `lang/<locale>/modules/tenant.php`.

### Option B: generate JSON for every file

Here you run one Artisan command that exports every PHP lang file to JSON:

```bash
php artisan erag:generate-lang
```

It mirrors the folder structure, so `lang/en/modules/user.php` becomes `resources/js/lang/en/modules/user.json`. Both paths are configurable in `config/inertia-lang.php` (`lang_path` and `output_lang`).

If you're wondering how the two options interact: when these JSON files exist, the package automatically shares all of them for the current locale in the `lang` prop, merged with anything you loaded through `syncLangFiles()`. On a conflict, the runtime-loaded value wins.

### Reading translations in components

Import the helper from the subpath for your framework (`@erag/lang-sync-inertia/vue`, `/react` or `/svelte`) and call it in the component. There's no plugin or provider to register.

```vue
<script setup lang="ts">
import { vueLang } from '@erag/lang-sync-inertia/vue';

const { __ } = vueLang();
</script>

<template>
    <h1>{{ __('modules.settings.delete_account.title') }}</h1>
</template>
```

React uses `reactLang()` and Svelte uses `svelteLang()`, and each one returns `__`, `trans`, `transChoice` and `trans_choice`. Placeholders work the Laravel way: `__('modules.user.welcome', { name: user.name })` replaces `:name`. When a key is missing, the helper returns the key itself, which makes gaps easy to spot on screen.

::: tip Key format
PHP uses a slash for sub-folders (`__('modules/settings.language.updated')`), components use dots everywhere (`__('modules.settings.language.updated')`).
:::

## Per-user and per-domain locale

The `lang` prop is resolved from `app()->getLocale()` when the response is built. That means choosing a language is really just a matter of setting the locale early in the request, and a middleware that runs before your Inertia middleware is enough:

```php
public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next): Response
{
    $default = $this->domainLocale($request) ?? config('app.locale');

    app()->setLocale($request->user()?->locale ?? $default);

    return $next($request);
}
```

For a SaaS, I'd use this order of preference:

1. the signed-in user's saved language (a nullable `locale` column on `users`),
2. the default language of the customer's domain or workspace,
3. the app default from `APP_LOCALE`.

Storing `null` when the user picks "Default" lets them follow their workspace's language automatically. Always validate the value against a list of supported locales, and fall back to your default for anything unknown. If your tenants run on subdomains, the domain lookup slots straight into this flow; [Laravel Multi-Tenancy with Subdomains](/blog/laravel-multi-tenancy-subdomains.html) covers that side.

## Translating validation messages

Validation, happily, needs no frontend work. Laravel translates messages on the server using `lang/<locale>/validation.php` and the current locale, and Inertia passes the finished strings to your forms in the `errors` prop.

For custom messages and field names, use the `messages()` and `attributes()` methods of a Form Request (or a Data object) and call `__()` inside them:

```php
public function attributes(): array
{
    return [
        'features' => __('modules/domain.validation.attributes.features'),
    ];
}
```

::: warning Translate at runtime, not at boot
Calling `__()` in a config file, a constant or a service provider runs before your locale middleware, so every user gets the default language. Call it inside methods that run during the request.
:::

This one tripped me up the first time, because nothing errors. Every user just quietly sees the default language.

## Organise translations by feature

One huge `messages.php` gets hard to maintain once you have more than a few screens. I'd keep Laravel's own files (`auth.php`, `validation.php`, `passwords.php`, `pagination.php`) at the top of each locale and put your own strings in **one file per feature**:

```text
lang/<locale>/
├── auth.php  validation.php  ...
└── modules/
    ├── dashboard.php  settings.php  tenant.php  user.php
```

That mirrors a [modular Laravel architecture](/blog/modular-laravel-architecture.html). When you add a module, you add its lang file, and it's obvious where every string lives. Nested keys like `index.title` or `toasts.created` keep each file readable.

## Pluralisation

Use Laravel's pipe syntax with explicit counts or ranges:

```php
'invitations' => '{0} No invitations|{1} One invitation|[2,*] :count invitations',
```

Then call `trans_choice('modules/user.invitations', $count)` in PHP, or `transChoice('modules.user.invitations', count)` in a component. The frontend helper fills in `:count` for you.

There's one difference between the two sides to watch for. Laravel's PHP side applies each language's plural rules to simple `singular|plural` strings. The frontend helper is simpler: without explicit counts, it uses the first form for 1 and the last form otherwise. So for languages with more than two plural forms, such as Russian or Polish, write explicit `{n}` and `[a,b]` ranges and both sides will agree.

## Keeping the translation payload small

Every Inertia response carries its props, so translations add weight to every page load and visit.

Generated JSON shares everything for the locale. That's convenient and fine for a typical dashboard, but if your lang files grow large, I'd switch to calling `syncLangFiles()` per page so each response only carries the groups it uses. What doesn't grow the payload is adding languages: only the current locale is sent, and the others never leave the server.

A few more habits help:

- Remove unused keys, since old strings cost bytes on every request.
- Keep long content out of lang files. Help articles and legal text belong in the database or in Markdown, not in a shared prop.
- Regenerate and commit the JSON as part of your workflow, so production never serves stale strings.

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need a frontend i18n library with Inertia?

Not necessarily. If your strings already live in Laravel lang files, sharing them through an Inertia prop and a small `__()` helper covers labels, placeholders and plurals. A dedicated library makes sense when you need heavy client-side formatting, or when you run a frontend without Laravel.

### Do I have to run erag:generate-lang after every change?

Yes, if you're using the generated JSON approach. The frontend reads the JSON, not the PHP files, so run `php artisan erag:generate-lang` after editing anything in `lang/`, and commit the output.

### How do I switch the language without a full page reload?

Save the user's choice with a normal Inertia request and redirect back. The next response is built with the new locale, so the `lang` prop, validation messages and server-side strings all update together.

### Does this work the same in Vue, React and Svelte?

Yes. The backend is identical and only the import changes: `vueLang` from `/vue`, `reactLang` from `/react` or `svelteLang` from `/svelte`. If you haven't picked a frontend yet, [Vue, React or Svelte for Your Laravel SaaS?](/blog/vue-react-or-svelte-laravel-saas.html) might help.

## How SaaS Laravel handles translations

The SaaS Laravel kits come with 17 languages set up this way, using `erag/laravel-lang-sync-inertia` with generated JSON committed in `resources/js/lang`. Strings are organised in one file per feature under `lang/<locale>/modules/`, and a `SetUserLocale` middleware picks the user's language, then the tenant domain's default, then `APP_LOCALE`. Users switch language from their profile or the user menu, and Data objects translate validation messages and attribute names. The details are in the [localization documentation](/docs/core/localization.html).
