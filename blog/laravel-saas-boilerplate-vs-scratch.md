# Laravel SaaS Boilerplate vs Building from Scratch: An Honest Decision Guide

<BlogPostMeta />

You've got a new product idea. Do you start from a Laravel SaaS boilerplate, or run `laravel new` and build everything yourself? Both are reasonable answers. Which one is right for you has less to do with the code than with your team, your deadline, and how standard your product really is.

We'll lay out what a SaaS actually needs, where the time goes, and the costs nobody puts on the sales page, on both sides. That includes the cases where we'd build from scratch.

## The features every SaaS needs before launch

Before comparing anything, list the invisible features. Customers expect them and never thank you for them. Most Laravel SaaS products need:

- Authentication: registration, login, password reset, email verification, two-factor authentication and, more and more often, passkeys
- Accounts or tenants: a workspace per customer, with its data kept apart from everyone else's
- Team management: inviting colleagues, removing them, handling expired invitations
- Roles and permissions: owners, admins and members, checked on routes, menus and buttons
- Settings: profile, password, language, appearance and per-workspace options
- An operator area: somewhere for *you* to see customers, suspend a workspace or put the app into maintenance
- Billing: plans, checkout, invoices and webhooks from your payment provider
- Plumbing: queues, transactional email, error pages, localization, layouts and navigation
- Quality: automated tests, static analysis, formatting and a CI pipeline

None of that is your product. All of it has to work before your first customer signs up.

## Where the work goes

We can't give you exact estimates without knowing your team and your requirements. Read the table as rough orders of magnitude for an experienced Laravel developer building it properly, with tests. It's not a quote.

| Area | Typical effort from scratch | What makes it grow |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authentication basics | Days | Custom flows, email templates |
| 2FA and passkeys | Days to a week or more | Recovery codes, device management, edge cases |
| Multi-tenancy | One to several weeks | Isolation model, queues, cache, files, migrations |
| Invitations and user management | Days | Expiring links, re-sending, queued email |
| Roles and permissions | Days to weeks | Protected roles, UI to manage them, frontend checks |
| Settings and layouts | Days | Dark mode, languages, responsive navigation |
| Localization | Days, then ongoing | Number of languages, validation messages |
| Billing | One to several weeks | Provider, taxes, trials, plan changes |
| Tests and CI | Ongoing | Everything above needs coverage |

Add it up and the foundation alone is usually **weeks to a few months** of focused work before you write one product-specific feature. A small team that has built SaaS apps before will land at the fast end. A solo developer doing it for the first time won't.

## The hidden costs of building from scratch

The first version is just the start, and the part people underestimate most is maintenance. Every feature you build is a feature you own. When invitations or 2FA break, the bug report lands on your desk instead of your product roadmap.

Security is the next one. Tenant isolation, permission checks on every route, rate limiting, signed and expiring links: each of these is easy to get *mostly* right. The gaps usually show up later, in production.

Then there are upgrades. Laravel ships a new major version every year, and your frontend framework, Inertia and every package keep moving too. Your custom code doesn't come with an upgrade guide. Consistency slips as well. Code written under deadline pressure drifts, with validation in one place and a fat controller in another, and every new developer pays for that daily.

And the cost we think matters most: opportunity cost. The weeks you spend on account settings are weeks you didn't spend talking to customers or building the feature that makes them pay.

## The hidden costs of a Laravel SaaS boilerplate

A boilerplate isn't free time either. Be honest with yourself about these.

### Conventions and fit

You inherit someone else's folder structure, naming and patterns. Budget time to read the code and the docs before you start adding features. Fit matters more, though. If the kit uses a different tenancy model, frontend or auth approach than your product needs, you'll be fighting it the whole way, and swapping the foundation later is expensive.

### Extra code, updates and licensing

Features you don't use still have to be understood, tested and eventually removed. And updates get harder the more you customise. Pulling in a new version is usually a Git merge, so the more of the kit's core files you edit, the more conflicts you resolve every time.

Read the license too. Check how many projects you can build, whether client work is allowed, and what happens if you stop paying. Also check what's missing, because no boilerplate covers your exact product. Billing varies the most: some kits include a provider, others leave the choice to you.

If you want a detailed list of what to look for in a kit, read our [Laravel SaaS starter kit buyer's guide](/blog/laravel-saas-starter-kit.html).

## Decision checklist

Answer each row for your own project:

| Question | Points to a boilerplate | Points to building from scratch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Is it a typical B2B SaaS (workspaces, teams, roles)? | Yes | No, the model is unusual |
| Is time to first customer important? | Weeks matter | You have months |
| Does the kit's tenancy model match yours? | Yes | No, and it's hard to change |
| Does your team know the kit's frontend? | Yes | No, and won't learn it |
| Do you want to learn how every piece works? | Not right now | Yes, that's a goal |
| Are there strict rules on third-party code? | No | Yes |
| Does the license fit how you'll use it? | Yes | No |

If most of your answers land on the left, a boilerplate will probably save you time. If several land on the right, build it yourself, or start from Laravel's official starter kit and add packages one at a time.

## When we'd build it ourselves

We'd skip a boilerplate if the product isn't a typical SaaS. An API-only service, an internal tool for one company or a content site doesn't need tenants, invitations and roles. Same if the data model is unusual: tenancy that follows geography, nested organisations, or resources shared across customers can all clash with a kit's assumptions.

It also makes sense when learning is the point. Building auth, [multi-tenancy](/blog/multi-tenant-saas-laravel-database-per-tenant.html) and [roles and permissions](/blog/laravel-roles-permissions-spatie.html) yourself is one of the best ways to really understand Laravel.

Two more cases. Agencies and teams that have shipped several SaaS apps often already maintain their own internal base, and there's no reason to replace it. And some organisations have compliance rules that make them write or fully audit every line, in which case the audit can cost more than the code.

::: tip A middle path
Laravel's official starter kits give you authentication and a frontend for free. For a simple product without tenants or complex roles, that plus a few well-known packages may be all you need.

## Frequently asked questions

### Is a Laravel SaaS boilerplate worth it for a solo developer?

Often, yes. Solo developers feel the opportunity cost the most, because every week spent on account settings is a week with no product work. Pick a kit whose stack you already know, so the learning cost stays small.

### Can I remove features I don't need from a boilerplate?

Usually. It's easier with a modular kit, where features live in their own folders. Removing a feature does mean more conflicts when you merge updates later, so we'd only remove what actually gets in your way.

### Will a boilerplate make my app slower?

Not on its own. A boilerplate is an ordinary Laravel application. Your queries, caching and hosting matter far more for performance than where the code came from.

### Can I switch from my own code to a boilerplate later?

You can, but it's rarely easy, because both sides own the same core: users, auth and tenancy. If you're on the fence, decide before there's real customer data.

## Where SaaS Laravel fits

SaaS Laravel is a boilerplate for the common case: database-per-tenant multi-tenancy, Fortify authentication with 2FA and passkeys, roles and permissions, invitations, 17 languages and a modular Laravel 13 backend, with the same backend behind Vue, React and Svelte frontends. It doesn't include billing, so you pick your own payment provider. It's a one-time payment (Vue $29, React $30, Svelte $33, or $79 for all three) with lifetime access and weekly updates that you [merge from the kit repository](/docs/purchase/updates.html). The [pricing page](/pricing.html) has the details.
