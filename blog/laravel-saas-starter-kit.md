# Laravel SaaS Starter Kit: What to Look For Before You Buy

<BlogPostMeta />

Every SaaS needs the same boring foundation before it can do anything interesting: sign-in, accounts, teams or tenants, roles and permissions, settings and an admin area. A **Laravel SaaS starter kit** is a Laravel application that already has those parts built, so you can spend your time on the features that make your product different.

Pick a good one and you skip weeks, sometimes months, of groundwork. Pick a bad one and you'll be fighting its architecture for years. Below is what we think a good kit should include, how we'd compare them, and the questions we'd ask before paying for one.

## What a Laravel SaaS starter kit actually is

Laravel's official starter kits are a clean place to begin. You get authentication, a dashboard layout and your choice of frontend. That's a solid base for any app, but a SaaS product needs a lot more on top of it.

A SaaS starter kit (people also call it a *Laravel SaaS boilerplate*) builds that extra layer for you. Usually that means:

- Multi-tenancy, so many customers share one application and each keeps its own data
- Team or tenant management: creating workspaces, inviting users, suspending accounts
- Roles and permissions that decide who can see and do what
- Stronger authentication with two-factor, passkeys and email verification
- Settings, layouts and localization, the details that make an app feel finished
- Tests and tooling, so you can change things without holding your breath

You buy or download it once and build your own product on top.

## Why start from a SaaS starter kit instead of from scratch

| Starting from scratch | Starting from a SaaS starter kit |
| --- | --- |
| Weeks spent on sign-in, tenants, roles and settings | Those parts already work on day one |
| Architecture decisions made under time pressure | A structure that was designed and tested up front |
| Security details (2FA, permissions, isolation) are easy to miss | Common security features are built in |
| Your first demo shows a login page | Your first demo shows your actual product idea |

The catch is that you're starting with someone else's code. That's exactly why the choice of kit matters so much.

## What a good Laravel SaaS starter kit should include

This is the checklist we'd use when comparing kits side by side.

### 1. Multi-tenancy that fits your product

Find out *how* the kit keeps customers apart. There are two common models.

With a single database, every table gets a `tenant_id`. It's simple, but every single query has to filter correctly, forever.

With a database per tenant, each customer gets their own database. You get stronger isolation, per-customer backups and exports, and no `tenant_id` cluttering your queries.

Neither one is right for every product. What matters is that you know which one you're buying. We go through the differences in [How to Build a Multi-Tenant SaaS with Laravel](/blog/multi-tenant-saas-laravel-database-per-tenant.html).

### 2. Complete authentication

A login form isn't enough. Look for registration, password reset, email verification, two-factor authentication with recovery codes and, more and more often, passkeys. If features can be switched on or off per customer, even better.

### 3. Roles and permissions

Most SaaS products need at least an owner, an admin and regular users. A good kit ships protected default roles, lets you add your own, and checks permissions on routes, menus and buttons. If it only checks in one of those places, something will slip through.

### 4. User management and invitations

Your customers will invite their colleagues. Check that invitation emails use secure, expiring links, and ideally that they go through a queue so they don't slow the app down.

### 5. A clean, readable architecture

Open the code before you commit to it. Can you find a feature quickly? Are controllers thin, with business logic in services? Is validation handled the same way everywhere? You'll live in this code every day, so this is the item we'd weigh most heavily. (It's also why the SaaS Laravel kits use a [module-based structure](/docs/core/architecture.html#why-a-module-based-structure).)

### 6. Your preferred frontend

A lot of kits support just one frontend. If your team writes React, a Vue-only kit is a poor fit, and the same goes the other way. With Inertia the backend doesn't change whichever frontend you pick. If you're undecided, [Vue, React or Svelte for Your Laravel SaaS?](/blog/vue-react-or-svelte-laravel-saas.html) should help.

### 7. Tests, types and tooling

Automated tests, static analysis and TypeScript support tell you someone maintains the kit seriously. They also protect you when you start changing things.

### 8. Documentation

Good docs explain *why*, not only *how*: the architecture, how to add a feature, how to deploy. If the docs are thin, you'll end up reading source code instead.

## Questions to ask before you buy

- Is it a one-time payment or a subscription? And what happens if you stop paying?
- How often is it updated, and how do updates reach you? A kit that isn't updated falls behind Laravel fast.
- What does the license allow? Unlimited projects? Client projects? Publishing or reselling it is usually not allowed.
- Which Laravel and PHP versions does it support?
- Is billing included, and with which provider? Some kits ship with one payment provider built in. Others leave the choice to you.
- Can you read the documentation before buying?

We'd put the update question first. A kit that stops tracking Laravel turns into a migration project on your side.

## Free vs premium Laravel SaaS kits

Free and open-source kits are great for learning and for small projects, and you can read every line before you start. They tend to be lighter on features and depend on the community to keep them going.

Premium kits cost money. In return you usually get more complete features (multi-tenancy, permissions, invitations), regular updates and documentation, plus someone whose job it is to keep the thing working.

Our rule of thumb is simple. If a kit saves you even a few days of development, a one-time price is almost always worth paying.

## How SaaS Laravel compares

[SaaS Laravel](/) is a premium **Laravel SaaS starter kit** built around the checklist above. Here's how it answers each point, including what it doesn't do:

| Checklist item | SaaS Laravel |
| --- | --- |
| Multi-tenancy | Database per tenant with stancl/tenancy, identified by subdomain, with automatic database creation, migrations and seeding |
| Authentication | Laravel Fortify with email verification, two-factor authentication, recovery codes and passkeys, switchable per domain |
| Roles and permissions | Spatie roles and permissions with seeded system roles, custom roles and permission checks on routes, menus and buttons |
| Users and invitations | User management with queued, signed invitation emails |
| Architecture | Module-based Laravel backend with thin controllers, services and Data objects |
| Frontend | Your choice of Vue, React or Svelte, all with TypeScript and shadcn-based components |
| Extras | 17 languages, per-domain settings, maintenance mode and workspace suspension, sidebar or header layouts |
| Tests and tooling | Pest, Larastan, Pint, ESLint, Prettier, a GitHub Actions workflow and Laravel Boost guidelines for AI agents |
| Billing | **Not included**, by design, so you can use Stripe, Paddle, Razorpay or any provider that fits your market |
| Pricing | One-time payment from $29 per kit, or $79 for all three, with lifetime access and weekly updates |

The full list is on the [features overview](/#features), and you can compare plans on the [pricing page](/pricing.html).

## Frequently asked questions

### What is the best Laravel SaaS starter kit?

The one that matches your product. That means the right multi-tenancy model, a frontend your team already knows, and a license and update policy you're comfortable with. Run your options through the checklist above and compare them side by side.

### Is a Laravel SaaS boilerplate the same as a starter kit?

Yes. "Boilerplate", "starter kit" and "SaaS kit" all mean the same thing: a pre-built Laravel application with the common SaaS features already in place, so you can build your product on top.

### Can I use a Laravel SaaS starter kit for client projects?

That depends on the license. The SaaS Laravel Commercial License allows unlimited projects for yourself or your clients, but not reselling or publishing the kit's source code. Whatever kit you look at, read its license before you buy.

### Do I need multi-tenancy for my SaaS?

If each customer has their own data, users and settings (a company, a school, a team), then yes, you need some form of multi-tenancy. The real question is which model: a shared database with a `tenant_id`, or a database per tenant.
