# Laravel User Locale: Letting Every User Choose Their Own Language

<BlogPostMeta />

Once your app speaks more than one language, someone will ask why it keeps switching back to English on their laptop. The fix is a Laravel user locale: the language a signed-in person has picked, saved on their account so it follows them to every device. Laravel hands you `app()->setLocale()` and the translator, then leaves the rest to you. Where do you store the choice, when do you apply it, and how do emails and background jobs end up in the same language?

We'll go through the full life of a per-user language preference here: the column, the enum of supported languages, the endpoint that saves it, where the middleware goes, guests, notifications and the frontend. If you're after sharing your `lang/` files with Vue, React or Svelte, that's in the pillar post on [Laravel Inertia translations](/blog/laravel-inertia-translations.html).

## Where a language preference can come from

Decide which sources you trust, and in what order, before you write any code. Each one fits a different situation:

| Source | Best for | Watch out for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Column on `users` | Signed-in users, every device | Needs a settings screen |
| Session or cookie | Guests on login and sign-up pages | Lost when the session ends or the browser changes |
| URL prefix such as `/de/` | Public, indexable pages | Every link must carry the prefix |
| `Accept-Language` header | A sensible first guess | Reflects the browser, not always the person |
| Workspace or domain default | Teams that all speak one language | Only exists once a tenant is known |
| `APP_LOCALE` | The final fallback | Same for everyone |

For the logged-in part of a SaaS, only the user column really matters. The rest fill the gaps before someone signs in, or when they never make a choice at all.

## Store the Laravel user locale on the users table

A short, nullable string column does the job. Ten characters leaves room for region codes like `pt_BR` if you add them later:

```php
Schema::table('users', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('locale', 10)->nullable()->after('email');
});
```

We treat `null` as "no preference", and we'd keep it that way rather than copying the default into every row. A user with `null` follows the workspace or app default, so when that default changes, it reaches them automatically. Don't forget to add `locale` to the model's fillable attributes.

Then keep the list of supported languages in one place. We like a backed enum for this, because the same enum drives validation, the options in a select and safe fallbacks:

```php
enum Language: string
{
    case English = 'en';
    case German = 'de';
    case Spanish = 'es';

    public static function resolve(?string $locale): self
    {
        return self::tryFrom((string) $locale) ?? self::English;
    }
}
```

`resolve()` turns anything unknown into your default. That includes `null` and a language you've since removed. Run every locale you read from the database, a cookie or a header through it.

## Saving the user's choice

Give the language its own small endpoint, like `PATCH /settings/language`, instead of burying it in the profile form. Then a language switcher in the user menu can change it with a single request.

Validate the value against the enum and allow `null` for "Default":

```php
public function rules(): array
{
    return [
        'locale' => ['nullable', 'string', Rule::enum(Language::class)],
    ];
}
```

Save it, switch the locale for the rest of this request, and redirect back:

```php
public function update(LanguageRequest $request): RedirectResponse
{
    $request->user()->update(['locale' => $request->validated('locale')]);

    app()->setLocale($request->validated('locale') ?? config('app.fallback_locale'));

    return back()->with('status', __('settings.language_updated'));
}
```

That `setLocale()` call is the one people forget. Your middleware already ran before the controller, so without it the success message comes out in the *old* language. In a real app, swap the fallback for the same workspace or app default your middleware uses.

With Inertia, the redirect back produces a fresh page response built in the new locale. Every string on screen updates, no full reload needed.

## Applying the locale on every request

A middleware reads the saved preference and calls `app()->setLocale()` at the start of each request. The pillar article already shows the [middleware body with a user, domain and app fallback](/blog/laravel-inertia-translations.html#per-user-and-per-domain-locale), so we'll stick to where it runs. That's where most of the bugs are.

It has to run **after** the session starts, so `$request->user()` works, and **before** anything that renders translated output, such as your Inertia middleware. In Laravel 11 and later you set that up in `bootstrap/app.php`:

```php
->withMiddleware(function (Middleware $middleware): void {
    $middleware->web(append: [
        SetUserLocale::class,
        HandleInertiaRequests::class,
    ]);

    $middleware->prependToPriorityList(
        before: HandleInertiaRequests::class,
        prepend: SetUserLocale::class,
    );
})
```

Appending to the `web` group puts it after `StartSession`. The priority entry keeps the order right even when route middleware gets sorted.

::: tip Read the default first
`app()->setLocale()` also writes to `config('app.locale')`. If you need the original default later in the request, for example to show "Default (English)" in a select, work it out before you override it and keep it on the request.
:::

Setting the locale also fires Laravel's `LocaleUpdated` event, and Carbon listens for it. So translated dates from `translatedFormat()` or `diffForHumans()` follow the user's language with no extra code.

## Guests: session, cookie and Accept-Language

There's no user yet on the login or sign-up page. We'd combine two light options here.

First, guess from the browser. Symfony's request object picks the best match from the languages you support:

```php
$supported = array_column(Language::cases(), 'value');

$locale = $request->session()->get('locale')
    ?? $request->getPreferredLanguage($supported);
```

Second, remember an explicit choice. A small language switcher on the guest pages stores the value in the session, and as the snippet shows, that choice wins over the browser guess.

When a guest signs up, copy their current locale into the new user's `locale` column. Their first email and their dashboard then match the language they registered in.

## Emails, notifications and queued jobs

HTTP middleware does nothing for a queue worker. A queued notification gets rendered later, in a separate process, with the app default locale, unless you tell Laravel otherwise.

The cleanest fix is to let the user model report its own language through the `HasLocalePreference` contract:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Translation\HasLocalePreference;

class User extends Authenticatable implements HasLocalePreference
{
    public function preferredLocale(): ?string
    {
        return $this->locale;
    }
}
```

Laravel checks this contract when it sends a notification to the user, and when you pass the user to `Mail::to()`. If it returns `null`, the app default applies.

Some people don't have a preference yet, like someone you're inviting. For them, set the language explicitly. Notifications and mailables both have a `locale()` method:

```php
$invitee->notify(
    (new InvitationNotification($url))->locale(app()->getLocale())
);
```

That sends the invitation in the inviter's current language, which is usually a better guess than the app default. [Queued jobs in a multi-tenant Laravel app](/blog/laravel-multi-tenant-queues.html) run into the same problem: anything that depends on request state has to be handed to the job explicitly.

## Share the locale with the frontend

Your components need to know the active language too. Share it as a prop, alongside the user's raw choice and the available options:

```php
'locale' => app()->getLocale(),
'userLocale' => $request->user()?->locale,
```

With both values, a select can show "Default" as selected when `userLocale` is `null`, while the page still renders in the resolved language. Also set `lang` on the root `html` element from `app()->getLocale()` in your root Blade view, since screen readers and browser translation tools rely on it. For formatting dates and numbers in the browser, see the post on building a [multilingual Laravel SaaS app](/blog/multilingual-saas-laravel.html).

## A per-user language checklist

Before we'd call this done, we'd check each of these:

- A nullable `locale` column, where `null` means "use the default"
- One enum or config list of supported languages, used for validation and options
- Every stored or guessed value goes through a `resolve()`-style fallback
- The save endpoint calls `setLocale()` before building its response
- The middleware runs after the session starts and before Inertia
- Guests get a session choice or an `Accept-Language` guess, copied on sign-up
- The user model implements `HasLocalePreference`
- Invitations and other mail to users without a preference set `locale()` explicitly

## Frequently asked questions

### Should I store the user's language in the session or the database?

The database, for signed-in users. That way the choice follows them to every device and into emails. The session is handy for guests and as a short-lived override, but it's gone once the session expires.

### How do I detect the browser language in Laravel?

Call `$request->getPreferredLanguage()` with the list of locales you support. It reads the `Accept-Language` header and returns the best match, or the first entry in your list when nothing matches. Treat it as a first guess and let people change it.

### Why are my queued emails sent in the wrong language?

Queue workers don't run your web middleware, so they fall back to the app default locale. Implement `HasLocalePreference` on the user model, or call `locale()` on the notification or mailable before you queue it.

### What happens if a user picked a language I later remove?

Nothing breaks, as long as every read goes through a fallback like `Language::resolve()`. The user sees your default language, and you can clean up their stored value with a one-off query.

## How SaaS Laravel handles per-user language

Everything above is how the SaaS Laravel kits handle it. `users.locale` is a nullable column in both the central and tenant databases, and `Modules\Settings\Enums\LanguageEnum` lists the 17 supported languages with a `resolve()` fallback. Users pick a language in their profile or from the user menu, which calls `PATCH /settings/language`. Choosing "Default" stores `null`, so they follow their tenant domain's default language or `APP_LOCALE`. The `SetUserLocale` middleware runs before the Inertia middleware, which then shares `locale`, `userLocale`, `defaultLocale` and `languages` with the frontend. The [localization documentation](/docs/core/localization.html) and the [per-domain language setting](/docs/core/domains.html) cover the details.
