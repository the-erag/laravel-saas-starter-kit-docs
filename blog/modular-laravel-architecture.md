# Laravel Modular Architecture: Organising a SaaS by Feature

<BlogPostMeta />

Sooner or later in a growing SaaS, changing one feature means hunting through half a dozen folders. A Laravel modular architecture fixes that by grouping code by feature instead of by type. Rather than one big `app/Http/Controllers` folder and one big `app/Services` folder, each feature (tenants, users, settings) gets its own folder with its own routes, controllers, services and service provider.

For a small app, Laravel's default layout is perfect, and we wouldn't touch it. For a SaaS product that keeps growing, organising by feature is often what keeps the codebase readable. Below we look at why, what a module looks like, how to stop modules tangling into each other, when not to bother, and how to add a new module step by step.

## Why the default app/ folder gets hard to manage

Laravel's default structure groups files by what they *are*. Controllers go in one place, form requests in another, and jobs, notifications and services each somewhere else. That works well while the app is small.

A SaaS application rarely stays small for long. Tenants, domains, authentication, roles and permissions, invitations, settings, menus and maintenance mode all share one codebase. After a while `app/Http/Controllers` holds dozens of unrelated controllers, and changing one feature means opening five or six folders to find all of its pieces. It gets hard to tell which classes belong together, or which ones are safe to delete. Two developers working on different features still end up in the same folders and collide.

None of that is Laravel's fault. "Grouped by type" simply stops telling you anything useful once there are many features.

## What a Laravel modular architecture looks like

In a modular Laravel app, each feature lives in `Modules/<Feature>`, and every module follows the same layout. Here's the `Tenant` module from the SaaS Laravel kits, slightly shortened:

```text
Modules/Tenant/
├── Data/            TenantRegisterData, DomainData, ...
├── Enums/           WorkspaceStatusEnum, IndustryEnum, ...
├── Http/
│   ├── Controllers/ TenantController, DomainController, ...
│   ├── Middleware/  EnsureTenantIsNotSuspended, ...
│   └── Requests/    AcceptInvitationRequest, ...
├── Jobs/            CreateTenantUserJob
├── Notifications/   TenantInvitationNotification, ...
├── Providers/       TenantServiceProvider
├── Repositories/    TenantRepository, DomainRepository
├── Services/        TenantService, DomainService, ...
└── routes/          web.php, tenant.php
```

Want to understand tenants? Open one folder. Smaller modules only get the folders they need: `Modules/Dashboard` is just a controller, a service provider and a routes file.

### Autoloading with PSR-4

You don't need a package for this. One PSR-4 entry in `composer.json` maps the `Modules\` namespace to the `Modules/` folder:

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        "App\\": "app/",
        "Modules\\": "Modules/"
    }
}
```

Run `composer dump-autoload` once after adding the mapping. From then on, a class like `Modules\Tenant\Services\TenantService` in `Modules/Tenant/Services/TenantService.php` loads like any other class.

### What stays in app/

Modules don't have to own everything, and we don't think they should. Shared infrastructure can stay where Laravel expects it. In the kits, the Eloquent models (`User`, `Tenant`, `Domain`, `Menu` and friends) live in `app/Models`, tenancy middleware and listeners live in `app/`, and migrations stay in `database/migrations`. The modules hold the feature logic built around them.

## How module service providers load routes

Every module has a service provider that registers its routes. Here's the one from `Modules/Dashboard`, minus its imports and empty `register()` method:

```php
class DashboardServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function boot(): void
    {
        $this->registerRoutes();
    }

    protected function registerRoutes(): void
    {
        Route::middleware('web')
            ->group(__DIR__.'/../routes/web.php');
    }
}
```

Each module provider is listed in `bootstrap/providers.php`, alongside the app's own providers. Since the modules load their own routes, the kits' `routes/web.php` is empty on purpose.

A provider can load more than one file. `TenantServiceProvider` loads both `routes/web.php` (central routes) and `routes/tenant.php` (tenant-only routes), and uses `register()` to bind `TenantAuthFeatureService` as a singleton. Our rule of thumb: whatever a module needs to set up, whether that's bindings, event listeners or route files, goes in that module's own provider.

Route caching doesn't change. `php artisan route:cache` caches every registered route, whichever provider registered it.

## Keeping modules loosely coupled

Folders alone don't make an architecture. If every module reaches into every other module, you've only moved the mess somewhere else. We keep modules independent with a few rules.

1. Most modules depend on nothing. A feature should work without knowing other features exist.
2. When a module does need another one, it uses that module's public pieces (its services, enums and Data objects) and never its internal details or tables.
3. **Dependencies point one way**, towards a small number of foundation modules. Foundation modules never depend on feature modules, so circular dependencies can't creep in.

Here's the real dependency map of the kits' seven modules:

```text
Auth, Dashboard, RolePermission, Settings  →  no module dependencies
Menu                                       →  Settings (layout settings)
Tenant                                     →  RolePermission (tenant admin role), Settings (languages)
User                                       →  RolePermission (roles and permissions)
```

As an example, the `User` module's `UserService` receives `PermissionService` from `RolePermission` through its constructor. It never queries the permission tables itself.

A quick search shows what a module depends on:

```bash
grep -rn "use Modules\\\\" Modules/User | grep -v "Modules\\\\User"
```

If you want the rules enforced automatically, Pest's architecture tests can do it, for example by asserting that `Modules\RolePermission` does not use `Modules\User`.

::: tip Foundation modules stay small
The fewer things a foundation module does, the fewer reasons other modules have to change when it changes. Resist adding feature logic to `Settings` or `RolePermission` just because everything already depends on them.

## When not to modularise

A modular Laravel architecture isn't free. It adds folders, providers and a steady stream of "where does this belong?" decisions. We'd skip it in the first three cases here:

| Situation | Better choice |
| --- | --- |
| A prototype or proof of concept | Default Laravel structure, since you may throw it away |
| A small app with a handful of controllers | Default structure; modules add more folders than features |
| One developer, one feature area | Default structure, maybe with a `Services` folder |
| A growing product with many features and a team | Feature modules |

You can also start with the default layout and move to modules later, which is what we'd suggest if you're not sure yet. PSR-4 and service providers are plain Laravel, so the move is mostly renaming namespaces and moving files, not rewriting logic.

## Step by step: adding a new module

Say you want a `Project` feature. Here's how we'd add it as a module.

### 1. Create the folders

Start with what you need: `Modules/Project/Http/Controllers`, `Providers`, `Services`, `Data` and `routes`. `Enums`, `Jobs` or `Repositories` can come later if the feature grows.

### 2. Add a service provider

Create `Modules/Project/Providers/ProjectServiceProvider.php` with the same `registerRoutes()` method as the Dashboard example above.

### 3. Register the provider

Add it to `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```php
use Modules\Project\Providers\ProjectServiceProvider;

return [
    // ...existing providers
    ProjectServiceProvider::class,
];
```

### 4. Add the routes

Put them in `Modules/Project/routes/web.php`, with whatever middleware the feature needs:

```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'verified'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('projects', [ProjectController::class, 'index'])->name('projects.index');
    Route::post('projects', [ProjectController::class, 'store'])->name('projects.store');
});
```

### 5. Keep the controller thin

Validate with a Data object or form request, call a service, return a response. Business logic and database transactions belong in `ProjectService`:

```php
public function store(ProjectData $data): RedirectResponse
{
    $this->projectService->create($data);

    return to_route('projects.index');
}
```

### 6. Depend in one direction only

If projects need permissions, inject `RolePermission`'s services. Never make `RolePermission` depend on `Project`.

### 7. Regenerate the frontend helpers

If you use typed routes, regenerate them so the frontend can call the new endpoints. See [Typed Routes with Laravel Wayfinder](/blog/laravel-wayfinder-typed-routes.html).

## Frequently asked questions

### Do I need a package to build Laravel modules?

No. A PSR-4 entry in `composer.json` and a service provider per module is all it takes. Module packages add generators and extra conventions, which some teams like, but they're optional.

### Where do models and migrations go in a modular Laravel app?

Either place works. Some teams put models inside each module. Others keep shared models in `app/Models` and migrations in `database/migrations`, because many features use the same models. We take the second approach in the SaaS Laravel kits.

### Does a modular structure make Laravel slower?

Not in any way you'd notice. Classes are still autoloaded on demand, providers do very little work, and route and config caching behave exactly as they do in a default app.

### Can a module have its own frontend pages?

With Inertia, pages usually stay in `resources/js/pages`, grouped by feature (for example `pages/tenants`). The module owns the backend, and the page folder mirrors it on the frontend.

## Modules in the SaaS Laravel kits

If you'd rather start with this already in place, the [SaaS Laravel kits](/) ship with it: seven modules (`Auth`, `Dashboard`, `Menu`, `RolePermission`, `Settings`, `Tenant` and `User`), each registered through its own service provider in `bootstrap/providers.php`, with an empty `routes/web.php` and one-way dependencies towards `RolePermission` and `Settings`. The Vue, React and Svelte kits all share the same backend. The details are in the [architecture documentation](/docs/core/architecture.html) and the [project structure guide](/docs/getting-started/project-structure.html), and our [Laravel SaaS starter kit guide](/blog/laravel-saas-starter-kit.html) shows how it fits into the bigger picture.
