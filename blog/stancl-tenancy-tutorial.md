# stancl/tenancy Tutorial: Build Your First Multi-Database Tenant in Laravel

<BlogPostMeta />

When a Laravel app needs multi-tenancy, [stancl/tenancy](https://tenancyforlaravel.com) is the package most teams reach for. In this stancl tenancy tutorial we'll take a fresh Laravel app to a working multi-database setup. You'll install the package, register it, create a `Tenant` model, add tenant migrations and routes, and then create a tenant and watch its database appear.

We're using version 3 of the package (3.10 at the time of writing), which supports Laravel 10 through 13. If you want the bigger picture first, [How to Build a Multi-Tenant SaaS with Laravel](/blog/multi-tenant-saas-laravel-database-per-tenant.html) explains how the pieces fit together.

## What you will have at the end

By the last step you'll have a central app on `localhost` for your marketing site, sign-up and admin, and tenants on their own hosts, such as `acme.localhost`. Each tenant gets its own database, created and migrated automatically when you create the tenant. Central and tenant migrations and routes live in separate places, so it's always clear which side a file belongs to.

## Step 1: Install stancl/tenancy

Require the package and run its installer:

```bash
composer require stancl/tenancy
php artisan tenancy:install
```

The installer publishes these files and creates one folder:

| File or folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `config/tenancy.php` | Tenant model, central domains, bootstrappers, database naming |
| `routes/tenant.php` | Routes that run inside a tenant |
| `app/Providers/TenancyServiceProvider.php` | Event listeners, including the tenant creation pipeline |
| Two migrations | The central `tenants` and `domains` tables |
| `database/migrations/tenant` | Migrations that run in every tenant database |

## Step 2: Register the service provider

The installer creates `TenancyServiceProvider`, but it doesn't register it. On Laravel 11 and later, add it to `bootstrap/providers.php`:

```php
return [
    App\Providers\AppServiceProvider::class,
    App\Providers\TenancyServiceProvider::class,
];
```

Don't skip this. **A missing provider is the most common reason nothing happens when you create a tenant**, because the provider is what listens for `TenantCreated` and creates the database.

## Step 3: Create your Tenant model

The package ships a base `Tenant` model. For database-per-tenant, though, you want your own model that knows about databases and domains:

```php
namespace App\Models;

use Stancl\Tenancy\Contracts\TenantWithDatabase;
use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Concerns\HasDatabase;
use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Concerns\HasDomains;
use Stancl\Tenancy\Database\Models\Tenant as BaseTenant;

class Tenant extends BaseTenant implements TenantWithDatabase
{
    use HasDatabase, HasDomains;
}
```

Then point the config at it:

```php
// config/tenancy.php
'tenant_model' => \App\Models\Tenant::class,
```

The `tenants` table has an `id`, timestamps and a `data` JSON column. Any attribute that isn't a real column is stored in `data` automatically, so `Tenant::create(['plan' => 'pro'])` just works. If you add real columns to the migration (say, `company`), list them in a static `getCustomColumns()` method on the model, and include `id` in that list.

## Step 4: Check the database settings

stancl/tenancy creates tenant databases on the same server as your central connection and uses that connection as a template. Two settings in `config/tenancy.php` matter here.

The first is `database.central_connection`, which defaults to `env('DB_CONNECTION', 'central')`. It has to be the name of the connection your central app actually uses, for example `mysql` or `pgsql`.

The second is the pair `database.prefix` and `database.suffix`, which build the database name as prefix + tenant ID + suffix. With the default prefix, tenant `acme` gets the database `tenantacme`.

The database user in your `.env` needs permission to create and drop databases. If two apps share one server, give each its own prefix before you create the first tenant. We'd do that even if you think you'll never share the server, because renaming tenant databases later is no fun.

MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and SQLite are all supported without extra setup. With SQLite, each tenant database is a file in the `database` folder.

## Step 5: Run the central migrations

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

That creates the `tenants` and `domains` tables in the central database, along with your normal central tables.

## Step 6: Add tenant migrations

Anything in `database/migrations/tenant` runs in every tenant database. Most apps want users inside the tenant, so copy Laravel's users migration there:

```bash
cp database/migrations/0001_01_01_000000_create_users_table.php database/migrations/tenant/
```

Keep the original too if your central app has its own users, such as platform admins. From here on, every new migration needs a decision: central app or tenants? [Tenant Migrations and Seeders in Laravel](/blog/laravel-tenant-migrations-seeders.html) goes deeper into that split, plus seeding and deployments.

## Step 7: Add a tenant route

`routes/tenant.php` already has an example group with `InitializeTenancyByDomain` and `PreventAccessFromCentralDomains`. Swap the example route for something that proves which database you're in:

```php
Route::get('/', function () {
    return 'Tenant '.tenant('id').' has '.\App\Models\User::count().' users';
});
```

`tenant('id')` reads an attribute of the current tenant. The domain lookup itself, and which identification middleware to pick, are covered in [Laravel Multi-Tenancy with Subdomains](/blog/laravel-multi-tenancy-subdomains.html).

## Step 8: Create your first tenant

Open Tinker and create a tenant with a domain:

```php
$tenant = App\Models\Tenant::create(['id' => 'acme']);

$tenant->domains()->create(['domain' => 'acme.localhost']);
```

Creating the tenant fires `TenantCreated`, and in the published provider that event runs a job pipeline:

```php
Events\TenantCreated::class => [
    JobPipeline::make([
        Jobs\CreateDatabase::class,
        Jobs\MigrateDatabase::class,
        // Jobs\SeedDatabase::class,
    ])->send(fn (Events\TenantCreated $event) => $event->tenant)
      ->shouldBeQueued(false),
],
```

So by now the `tenantacme` database exists and has a `users` table. Leave out the `id` and the default `id_generator` gives the tenant a UUID instead.

Start the dev server with `php artisan serve` and open `http://acme.localhost:8000`. Chrome and Firefox resolve `*.localhost` to your own machine, so you should see "Tenant acme has 0 users". If your browser doesn't, add the host to `/etc/hosts` or use a local tool that handles wildcard subdomains. Note that `http://localhost:8000` is a central domain in the default config, so tenant routes return a 404 there.

## Step 9: Run code in a tenant from anywhere

Sometimes you're outside a tenant request, in a command or on an admin page, and need to run code inside a tenant. That's what `run()` is for:

```php
$tenant->run(function () {
    \App\Models\User::factory()->create(); // written to tenantacme
});
```

`run()` initializes tenancy, calls your closure and then goes back to the previous context. It works the other way round too: `tenancy()->central(fn () => ...)` runs a closure in the central context while you're inside a tenant.

## What the bootstrappers switch for you

When tenancy starts, the bootstrappers listed in `config/tenancy.php` make parts of Laravel tenant-aware. By default that's the database connection, the cache, the `local` and `public` disks, and queued jobs. There's a Redis bootstrapper as well, but it's commented out. Each one has its own behaviour and pitfalls, and [Tenant-Aware Cache and File Storage](/blog/laravel-tenant-cache-filesystem.html) goes through them in detail.

## Common mistakes when following a stancl/tenancy tutorial

| Symptom | Likely cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Creating a tenant creates no database | Provider not registered | Add `TenancyServiceProvider` to `bootstrap/providers.php` |
| `CREATE DATABASE` permission error | Database user lacks privileges | Grant create and drop rights to the app's user |
| Tenant tables are missing | Migration is in `database/migrations` | Move it to `database/migrations/tenant` and run `php artisan tenants:migrate` |
| Your central home page returns a 404 | The tenant `/` route replaces the central `/` route, which has no domain | Wrap central routes in `Route::domain()` for each central domain |
| Production shows your real domain as a tenant | `central_domains` still lists only `127.0.0.1` and `localhost` | Add your production domain |

The central route fix is a small loop in `routes/web.php`:

```php
foreach (config('tenancy.central_domains') as $domain) {
    Route::domain($domain)->group(function () {
        Route::get('/', fn () => view('welcome'));
    });
}
```

## Frequently asked questions

### Does stancl/tenancy work with Laravel 13?

Yes. Version 3.10 of the package supports Laravel 10, 11, 12 and 13. Install it with Composer as shown above. The Laravel version doesn't need any extra configuration.

### Can tenants use auto-increment IDs instead of UUIDs?

Yes. Set `id_generator` to `null` in `config/tenancy.php`, then change the `id` column in the tenants migration, and `tenant_id` in the domains migration, to integers. Database names become `tenant1`, `tenant2` and so on.

### Should the tenant creation pipeline be queued?

The published provider runs it synchronously, and its own comment suggests queuing it in production. Queuing keeps sign-up fast, but the tenant is only usable once the worker has finished, and the jobs can't rely on the HTTP request. We'd keep it synchronous while you're building, and queue it once sign-up speed actually matters.

### Can each tenant have its own database user?

Yes. For MySQL, switch the `mysql` manager in `config/tenancy.php` to `PermissionControlledMySQLDatabaseManager`. It creates a database user per tenant, with grants limited to that tenant's database.

## How SaaS Laravel sets this up

If you'd rather skip the setup, the [SaaS Laravel starter kits](/) already run stancl/tenancy 3 in multi-database mode with everything from this tutorial done. The `App\Models\Tenant` model uses auto-increment IDs with real columns for company and contact details, and tenant domains are subdomains of `APP_DOMAIN`. The creation pipeline creates the database, runs the tenant migrations, seeds roles, permissions and menus, and creates the tenant's first admin. Tenants are created and managed from a central admin screen. The [multi-tenancy documentation](/docs/core/multi-tenancy.html) has the details.
