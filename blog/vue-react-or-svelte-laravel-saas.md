# Vue, React or Svelte for Your Laravel SaaS? How to Choose

<BlogPostMeta />

"Which frontend should we use?" comes up on almost every new Laravel SaaS project, and it can turn into a long debate. Should it be Vue, React or Svelte for your Laravel SaaS? If you build with **Inertia**, I'd like to reassure you before we start: the choice matters much less than it feels like it does.

Below I'll show what actually changes between Vue, React and Svelte in a Laravel + Inertia app, compare them fairly, and give you a simple way to decide.

## Why Inertia makes the choice smaller

With Inertia, Laravel stays in charge. Routes, controllers, validation, authorization and data loading all live in PHP, exactly as they would in a classic Laravel app. The one difference is that instead of returning a Blade view, a controller returns a page component and its props:

```php
public function index(): Response
{
    return Inertia::render('projects/Index', [
        'projects' => Project::query()->latest()->get(),
    ]);
}
```

You don't have a separate API to design, version or secure for your own frontend. The only part that differs between frameworks is the page component that receives those props:

::: code-group

```vue [Vue]
<script setup lang="ts">
const props = defineProps<{ projects: Project[] }>();
</script>
```

```tsx [React]
export default function Index({ projects }: { projects: Project[] }) {
    // render the list
}
```

```svelte [Svelte]
<script lang="ts">
    let { projects }: { projects: Project[] } = $props();
</script>
```

:::

So if you're worried about picking the wrong architecture, you can relax a little. You aren't choosing an architecture here. You're choosing how you like to write components.

## What stays the same, whichever you pick

Almost everything on the server. Routing, controllers and middleware don't change. Neither do validation and error messages, since Inertia passes errors to your forms automatically. Authentication, roles and permissions stay in PHP, and so do multi-tenancy, queues, mail and the rest of the backend.

If you use tools like Wayfinder, you also keep typed routes and types generated from your PHP classes, in every framework.

## How Vue, React and Svelte compare

| | Vue | React | Svelte |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Style | Single-file components with `<script setup>` | JSX and hooks | Single-file components with runes (Svelte 5) |
| Learning curve | Gentle, HTML-first templates | Moderate: JSX, hooks and their rules | Gentle, with the least boilerplate |
| Ecosystem | Large, very popular in the Laravel community | The largest ecosystem and job market | Smaller, but growing quickly |
| Reactivity | Refs and computed values | Re-renders and hooks | Compiler-based runes (`$state`, `$derived`) |
| shadcn-style components | shadcn-vue | shadcn/ui | shadcn-svelte |
| TypeScript | Excellent | Excellent | Excellent |

All three are production-ready, fast enough for any SaaS dashboard, and fully supported by Inertia.

## When to choose each one

### Choose Vue if…

Your team already knows Laravel and wants something that feels familiar. Vue has long been a favourite in the Laravel community, its templates look like HTML, and the logic sits in a `<script setup>` block. If backend developers on your team also write frontend code, Vue's gentle learning curve makes that easier.

### Choose React if…

Your team already writes React, or you're planning to hire frontend developers, because React has the largest talent pool. It's also the natural pick if you need a specific library that only exists for React, or if you might later share components or knowledge with a React Native mobile app.

### Choose Svelte if…

You want the least code for the same result. Svelte 5 components are short and very readable, and the compiler-first approach gives you fine-grained reactivity. It suits a small team that values simplicity more than ecosystem size.

## Vue, React or Svelte: a simple decision guide

1. Does your team already know one of them well? Use it. Familiarity beats any benchmark.
2. Are you hiring frontend developers soon? React is the safest bet for the job market.
3. Is your team mostly Laravel developers? Vue or Svelte will probably feel the most natural.
4. Still undecided? Build one real screen, a form with validation and a table, in each. The one your team enjoys most is the right answer.

If you only answer the first question, that's usually enough. I'd put team familiarity above every other factor in this post.

## Everyday tasks in each framework

The Inertia API is almost identical across the three adapters. What changes is how each framework expresses it:

| Task | Vue 3 | React 19 | Svelte 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Receive page props | `defineProps<...>()` | Function parameters | `let { ... } = $props()` |
| Local state | `ref()` / `computed()` | `useState()` / derived values | `$state` / `$derived` |
| Set a page's layout | `defineOptions({ layout })` | `Page.layout = ...` | `export const layout` in `<script module>` |
| Read shared props | `usePage()` | `usePage()` | The reactive `page` object |
| Forms | `<Form>` or `useForm()` | `<Form>` or `useForm()` | `<Form>` or `useForm()` |
| React to changes | `watch()` | Event handlers or `useEffect()` | `$effect()` |
| Type checking | `vue-tsc` | `tsc` | `svelte-check` |

Try reading down each column. If one reads naturally to your team, take that as a strong hint.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can I switch frameworks later?

With Inertia, yes, and more easily than with a separate SPA. Your routes, controllers and validation stay as they are; only the page components in `resources/js` need rewriting. For a large app that's still real work, so choose deliberately, but you're not locked in.

### Is Laravel better with Vue or React?

Neither is better for Laravel itself. Both have official Inertia adapters and first-class Vite support. Vue has a long history in the Laravel community, and React has the largest ecosystem and hiring pool. Pick the one your team writes best.

### Is Svelte ready for a production Laravel SaaS?

Yes. Svelte 5 with runes is stable, Inertia has an official Svelte adapter, and shadcn-svelte gives you the same style of accessible components as the other two. Its ecosystem is smaller, so check that any library you rely on has a Svelte version.

### Do I need TypeScript?

It's optional, but I'd use it in a SaaS codebase. With tools that generate types from your PHP classes and routes, the compiler catches a renamed prop or route before your users do, in all three frameworks.

## Same backend, three frontends

The [SaaS Laravel starter kits](/) are built around this idea. The Laravel backend (multi-tenancy, authentication, roles and permissions, invitations and localization) is identical in every kit. You pick the [Vue](/kits/vue.html), [React](/kits/react.html) or [Svelte](/kits/svelte.html) kit for the frontend your team prefers, and each one comes with its own shadcn-based components and TypeScript support.
